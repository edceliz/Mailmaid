<pre>POST /path_to_mailmaid/subscriber/subscribe</pre>
<p>Fields to send: email, listId</p>
<p><strong>email</strong> - E-mail address of the subscriber.</p>
<p><strong>listId</strong> - ID of the subscriber list. You can find this when going to Mailmaid's panel->Subscribers</p>
<pre>Response: { status: true|false }</pre>

<h2>Mails Per Hour (Settings)</h2>
<p>Mailmaid is not responsible for any misuse of server's resources. There is a setting in the admin panel to provide the allotted e-mail that can be sent per hour. Be sure to know your server provider what is the allotted e-mails that can be sent per hour by your account. It is heavily recommended to avoid using the whole allocation in order to provide resources to other applications that might use it.</p>
